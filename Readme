The repository is for hosting code for identifying processed pseudogenes. The pipeline was used on Xenopus tropicalis 9.1 and 
Xenopus laevis 9.2 genomes. There are in total 3802 and 22996 processed pseudogenes identified for tropicalis and laevis, respectively.
The analysis pipeline was written based on the description from two papers by Zhang et al 2002 and 2003. Here are the references for
the two papers:

Zhang Z, Harrison P, Gerstein M. Identification and analysis of over 2000 ribosomal protein pseudogenes in the human genome. Genome 
Res. 2002 Oct;12(10):1466-82.

in the human genome. Genome Res. 2003 Dec;13(12):2541-58.

We outline the analysis pipeline here:

Identification of processed pseudogenes

1)	Download repeat masked genome sequences and protein sequences

2)	Align protein sequences to genome using six-frame Blast search for searching for raw fragment homologies of protein sequences

    Chromosomes are split into smaller overlapping chunks of 5.1 mb.
    Program tblastn is used for blasting
    Default SEG low-complexity filter parameters (12 2.2 2.5) are used in the homology search. Significant value (e-value<1e-4) is used
    
3)	Removing overlaps with annotated genes
    Compare the chromosomal locations of the Blast hits with the location of the annotate genes, and if overlapping significantly
    with an annotated gene, the matches are removed from the set

4)	Merge adjacent fragment homologies into single protein matches
    Two adjacent homology fragments, M1 and M2, which match same protein, will be merged if they satisfy the following two criteria: 
    a)	|q_21-q_12|<=max(20, 0.2*L) and c_21-c_12<=5000, where L denotes the length of the query protein sequence
    b)	c_22-c_21<=60

5)	Optimization from Smith-Waterman alignment of merged matches
    Extend each match on both sides to equal the length of the protein they matched plus 30 bp.
    The protein sequences are aligned to the extended matches using the Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm implemented by program FASTA. 
    Matches are cleaned up by removing redundant matches, splitting matches with gaps longer than 60 bp. 
    The resulting matches are processed pseudogene candidates
    
6)	Checking for frame disruptions

7)	Identify processes pseudogenes
    Label them as processed pseudogenes if they meet two criteria:
    a)	They contain gaps of shorter than 60 bp, that is c_21-c12<=60
    b)	They produced transcripts longer than 70% of the protein sequence they matched (the alignment covers .70% of the coding sequence (CDS))

8)	Further verification by poly-A signal
